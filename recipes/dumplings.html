        <h4>What Are Dumplings?</h4>
        <p>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed.</br>
        There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings.
        </br>These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.
        </br>They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.

    <h2>Ingredients and steps</h2>
    
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Flour</b></br>
                These dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together. </li>
            <li><b>Baking Powder</b></br>
                Baking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture. </li>
            <li><b>White Sugar</b></br>
                A teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings.</li>
            <li><b>Salt</b></br>
                A pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. </li>
            <li><b>Butter or Margarine</b></br>
                Cold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender.</li>
            <li><b>Milk</b></br>
                Whole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough.</li>
            </ol>
